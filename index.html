    <p>When my girlfriend Nicole and I decided that we would be moving from San Diego to St. Louis,
        Nicole knew immediately that we would need to stop at the Grand Canyon on the way. 
        She had always wanted to visit the Grand Canyon, and although I had been previously during a trip for work, I couldnt wait to go back.
        So we packed all of our belongs in a Uhaul container and headed toward Flagstaff.

   <p>Our cat Cheeze joined us for the ride. However she didn't seem to enjoy the scenery as much as we did, 
       choosing instead to sit backwards meowing loudly toward the rear window of the car for hours on end.

   <p>We arrived at Grand Canyon National park just as the sun rose and were greeted at the front gates by an enormous elk.
       It was an amazing experience to be standing so close to such a big creature in the wild and he seemed content to ignore us
       while we gauked at him and took photos.

   <p>The Grand Canyon proved to as beautiful as I remembered and as Nicole had hoped.
       The breathtaking scenery made for a wonderful start for day 1 of our 3 day journey to St. Louis.
